Hello Investors! 

It's a pleasure to greet you guys in this repository. My name Irsyad Adhyma, a graduates from School of Business Management ITB, and a private asset manager at AAP Investment Trust. As one of the regulated fund managers in Indonesia, I saw a huge potential of developing a 'Quantitative Trading Strategies' in Indonesia.

Quantitative Strategies (or later called 'Quant') is one of the modern strategies implemented in financial industry as there was a huge development in Big Data and Machine Learning. As you know, soon in 2030 will be predicted to be one of a great shifting in Industry since most of the repetitive task will be replaced by AI (artificial intelegence) and one of the repetitive task is BUILDING INVESTMENT THESIS/DECISION.

## So what is Quant? if you're wondering.

Quantitive Strategies is the term used in using Multiple Historical or Current Big Data which related to Financial Market to Build a Financial Model to predict how the assets price will move in the future.

Quantitative trading originated in the early 20th century as financial markets began embracing mathematical models for trading decisions. Using computer algorithms and models to identify and act on trading opportunities has significantly evolved over time. Initially, quantitative traders operated at both individual and institutional levels, managing various tasks to cope with the complexities of the markets.

Advantages like the ability to process large datasets systematically have driven interest in systematic trading approaches. However, the field also comes with its challenges, including technological reliance and substantial risks of losses.

The foundation of modern quantitative finance was laid by Louis Bachelier in 1900 with his thesis introducing the concept of Brownian motion to finance. Bachelier’s work, though not widely recognized at the time, paved the way for future developments in quantitative finance. His introduction of Brownian motion provided a mathematical framework that influenced the development of quantitative models, setting the stage for more sophisticated trading strategies.

## Brief History

The 1960s and 1970s were transformative years for quantitative finance, marked by the introduction of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) by Harry Markowitz. MPT revolutionized investment strategies by emphasizing diversification to optimize portfolio performance. The theory introduced the concept of the efficient frontier, which highlights the optimal portfolio combinations for given risk levels.

During this period, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) was also developed, providing a way to estimate expected asset returns based on their systematic risk. CAPM quantified the relationship between risk and expected return, significantly influencing asset pricing and investment decisions.

In 1973, the Black-Scholes model transformed the field of option pricing by providing a mathematical formula to calculate the theoretical value of European-style options. This model revolutionized derivatives trading by introducing a systematic approach to pricing options, significantly impacting risk management and trading strategies.

The Black-Scholes model’s assumptions, including constant volatility and frictionless markets, were pivotal in its application and spurred further advancements in financial theories. Enabling traders to assess risk and reward more accurately, the model shaped modern derivatives markets and remains a cornerstone of quantitative finance.

The 1980s witnessed the rise of algorithmic trading, significantly influenced by the increased utilization of computers and electronic trading systems. Technological advancements, financial regulation, and innovation in financial products contributed to the adoption of algorithmic trading strategies in the stock market.

Hedge funds were among the early adopters of algorithmic trading, using algorithms to identify and exploit trading opportunities. Electronic trading systems allowed for quicker and more efficient trade execution, marking a significant shift in how trades were conducted.

Algorithmic trading emerged as a dominant force in financial markets by the late 1980s and early 1990s.

## FrameWork:
Big Data (Historical/Current Data) -> Analyzed, Shorted, Clean Data -> Building a Financial Model -> Use the Data to Predict future Asset Price -> Evaluate Model (Update Data, Change Financial Model) -> REPEAT

## Last Word

In order to adapt the change we face soon, here I want to documented my own journey to build portofolio costruction strategies using python. The most easy to understand and compatible to many programming language.
